abstract = "Survival during early marine life stages is hypothesized to contribute disproportionately to variation in salmonid recruitment, yet estimates of cumulative mortality are constrained by knowledge of how long juveniles reside in specific regions. We used otolith microstructure techniques to examine the relationship between migratory rate and ocean entry characteristics of juvenile sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka). We observed differences in migratory rate between catch locations that are consistent with divergent migratory behaviours. Individuals captured in northern regions were typically older, larger at ocean entry, and migrated more rapidly. Migratory rate was also correlated with entry size, phenology, population group, and year. Next, we compared “lingering” individuals captured nearshore during fall surveys to juveniles from the same populations captured during the peak summer migratory period. We determined that individuals that entered after 24 May and at smaller sizes (<85 mm) had a greater probability of being captured late in the year. Our findings demonstrate that the entry character- istics of sockeye salmon are strongly correlated with migratory variation within populations and suggest these traits may directly influence juvenile behaviour."
