I am a biologist at Fisheries and Oceans Canada's Pacific Biological Station in Nanaimo, British Columbia. I am currently working with Dr. Jackie King's Basin and Coastal-scale Interactions program to research the spatial and temporal distribution of Chinook salmon in Southern Resident Killer Whale critical habitat. Prior to this, I was a postdoc under Dr. Carrie Holt in the Quantitative Assessment Methods Section at PBS where I designed stochastic, closed-loop simulation models to develop rebuilding strategies for depleted Pacific salmon populations.

I use a mix of quantitative modeling and field-based methods to answer management-driven ecological questions. I am particularly interested in interactions between large scale environmental drivers, life history diversity, and fisheries productivity. I believe that effective fisheries management depends on pairing knowledge of natural history with robust quantitative techniques.
